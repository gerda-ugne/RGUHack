# RGUHack 2020 - Dream realm
Dream realm is a single-player text-based adventure game, based in a kingdom of your dreams. Proud to announce that we are the winners of RGUHack 2020 Codify's challenge to create a text-based adventure game!

# DREAM REALM
## Introduction:
You find yourself awake in a dark, mysterious place. It appears you're in a maze, alone and lost. As you start exploring your surroundings, you happen to find a lantern, which guides your way through the labyrinth. But be aware - if you run out of oil, the light will go off and you will be consumed by your worst fears. Your nightmare terrors are watching you, but fortunately, you have lonely travellers to help you guide your way and they might even provide you with some useful items if you are willing to pay. Find the exit and you shall wake up from your worst nightmare!

## Summary:
Each time the game is launched, a new maze is generated. However, due to the darkness, player can only see a small area around them while exploring. Player can interact with travellers by walking on their icon, fight monsters the same way too. Be aware of traps - the player has to use check for traps function in order to disable them.

### Oil mechanic:
Each move consumes oil that your lantern needs. You can find oil by defeating monsters or trading travellers. Running out of oil results in a game over, since you cannot see anything in your path anymore.

### Traps:
Player must be aware of traps. First encounter of a trap will explain how the mechanics work. Any other step on the trap will result in a game over. In order to disable the trap, the player has to use check for traps option in the menu. Player can disable them by throwing rocks at them. In case player is out of rocks, they can be bought from travellers or found after killing a monster.

### Fighting terrors:
Player is able to fight terrors. Be aware of your health - you can use consumables to heal your health and focus points. To obtain more consumables, player has to either defeat monsters or trade travellers.

## End goal:
Find the exit of the maze!
